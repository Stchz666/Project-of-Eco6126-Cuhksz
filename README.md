# Project-of-Eco6126-Cuhksz
This code and its accompanying report are the results of my assignment for the Machine Learning course(ECO6126) during my first year of master’s studies. Frankly speaking, if I divide this semester’s learning into two phases—with the period before Test 1 as the first phase and the rest as the second—my learning experience in the first phase was undoubtedly filled with struggles. Fortunately, after entering the second phase, I suddenly had an epiphany and truly grasped the essence of "machine learning."
However, during the final course presentation, when I saw that other classmates’ reports combined depth with cutting-edge perspectives, I couldn’t help but feel a sense of humility, realizing there was still a significant gap between their work and mine. Yet, the more than 40 hours I invested in completing the assignment and exploring the knowledge were filled with pure joy. As a beginner in Python, I had never worked on a complete project before, but I ultimately finished the code writing independently, step by step, relying solely on my own efforts. I don’t regret my slow start or the time I spent; instead, I am overjoyed that I finally took a solid, small step forward on my technical journey.
I also completed the final PDF report almost entirely on my own. Having never used LaTeX before, what could have been a one-hour task with Word ended up taking me nearly ten hours to complete. But when I saw the exquisite typesetting and rigorous formatting of the final report, I was deeply touched and firmly believed that all my efforts had not been in vain.
I am well aware that there are countless details in both the report and the code that await optimization. It reminds me of that night when I pulled an all-nighter writing code: I looked up at the supposedly profound night sky, dotted with a few scattered stars—those imperfections are precisely the promise of endless room for growth in the future. Thank you to the persistent version of myself.
